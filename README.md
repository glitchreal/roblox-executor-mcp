# Roblox Executor MCP Server

An MCP server that allows Agents to interact with a running Roblox game client — execute code, inspect scripts, spy on remotes, and more.

## Dashboard

Roblox Executor MCP includes a local web dashboard at:

```text
http://localhost:16384/
```

Use it to see connected Roblox clients, inspect scripts, run tools, view server logs, configure semantic search, and index games for semantic script search.

## Features

- **Code Execution** — Run Lua code and fetch data from the game client.
- **Script Inspection** — Decompile scripts and search across all sources.
- **Instance Search** — CSS-like selectors and hierarchy trees.
- **Remote Spy** — Intercept, log, block, and ignore Remotes/Bindables via [Cobalt](https://github.com/notpoiu/cobalt).
- **GUI Interaction** — Click buttons and type into text boxes.
- **Screenshot** — Capture Roblox window screenshots (Windows only).
- **Multi-Client** — Connect multiple Roblox clients at once.

## Tutorial

[![roblox-executor-mcp installation guide](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Tcy5RNf1TRc/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Tcy5RNf1TRc)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **Bun** ≥ 1.3 for the interactive OpenTUI harness installer
- **A Roblox executor** that supports `loadstring`, `request`, and (preferably) `WebSocket`

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notpoiu/roblox-executor-mcp.git
cd roblox-executor-mcp
```

### 2. Run the installer

The installer opens a guided browser setup. It builds the server, configures selected AI harnesses, optionally installs the packaged Roblox MCP skill and Roblox connector, and can register the shared server to run in the background with your computer.

```bash
npm run install:harnesses
```

The browser opens with a one-time secure installer link. Keep the terminal open until setup finishes. The normal server build consumes the committed `connector.luau` artifact, so installs do not require Darklua. Connector developers can install the pinned tool with `rokit install`, edit `connector-src/`, and regenerate the artifact with `npm run build:connector`.

For a terminal-only setup, use the explicit CLI installer. The CLI picker is built with [OpenTUI](https://opentui.com/) and runs through Bun:

```bash
npm run install:harnesses:cli
```

If the interactive terminal picker is unavailable, add `-- --plain`. Press `s` in the picker or pass `-- --show-all-harnesses` to reveal every supported config target. After writing configs, both installers can automatically restart supported GUI harnesses that are currently running. CLI-only harness sessions still receive a restart instruction when they cannot be relaunched safely.

To explore the browser flow without changing configs, installing packages, registering a service, or restarting harnesses, run:

```bash
npm run install:harnesses:preview
```

Pass `-- --no-open` to either browser command to start it without opening a browser. Pass `-- --host 0.0.0.0` to access it from another device over your LAN or Tailscale; use the complete tokenized URL printed by the installer.

The installer can also place the Roblox loader into a detected executor autoexec folder, such as MacSploit on macOS or supported Windows executor autoexec folders. Use the prompt, or run:

```bash
npm run getscript -- --autoexec
```

It can also help with:

- cross-machine setup on the same LAN
- copying the Roblox loader to your clipboard
- optional Ollama `embeddinggemma` setup for semantic indexing
- pulling latest repo changes before install/build

To update an existing install later, run:

```bash
npm run update
```

You can also open **Dashboard → Settings → Server updates** and select **Update now**.

### Manual setup

If you prefer to configure a client yourself, use the setup guide for your client:

| Client         | Guide                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Cursor         | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-cursor.md)         |
| Claude Desktop | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-claude-desktop.md) |
| Claude Code    | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-claude-code.md)    |
| Codex CLI      | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-codex.md)          |
| Windsurf       | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-windsurf.md)       |
| Antigravity    | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-antigravity.md)    |
| BLACKBOX AI    | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-blackbox.md)       |
| ZCode          | [Setup Guide](docs/setup-zcode.md)          |

### 3. Connect from Roblox

The installer prints this for you. Put it in your executor or Auto Execute:

```lua
while not getgenv().MCP_Loaded do
    local bridgeUrl = getgenv().BridgeURL or "localhost:16384"
    pcall(function() loadstring(game:HttpGet("http://" .. bridgeUrl .. "/script.luau"))() end)

    task.wait(0.15)
end
```

**Optional settings** (set before the `loadstring`):

```lua
getgenv().BridgeURL = "10.0.0.4:16384"                  -- default: localhost:16384
getgenv().DisableWebSocket = true                        -- force HTTP polling
getgenv().DisableInitialScriptDecompMapping = true       -- skip initial decompilation
getgenv().MCP_FailedScriptResyncInterval = 30            -- retry failed script syncs periodically
getgenv().MCP_FailedScriptResyncBatchSize = 8            -- bound each periodic retry batch
```

After the MCP server starts and Roblox connects, open the dashboard:

```text
http://localhost:16384/
```

## Security

> **This server allows arbitrary code execution.** Only use with AI clients you trust. Port `16384` has no authentication — **never expose it to the internet.** For cross-machine setups, use a local network, VPN, or SSH tunnel. See [Advanced](docs/advanced.md) for details.
