# Modern runtime patterns

Use these patterns when specialized MCP inspection tools cannot answer the question directly.

## Return data instead of printing it

Use `get-data-by-code` for read-only custom probes and whenever the result matters to the task:

```luau
local player = game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer

return {
    Name = player.Name,
    UserId = player.UserId,
}
```

Return raw strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and small dictionaries. The connector serializes them. Do not call `HttpService:JSONEncode`, return whole instances, or return large/unbounded tables.

Use `execute` or `execute-file` only when the primary purpose is a side effect:

```luau
workspace.CurrentCamera.FieldOfView = 90
```

Execution is scheduled, not proof of success. Follow it with a specialized inspection tool or a small `get-data-by-code` probe. A console read is appropriate only when logs themselves are the evidence.

## Filter garbage-collected values with `filtergc`

Prefer `filtergc` over a raw `getgc` loop. Provide every known criterion so the runtime narrows the search:

```luau
local target = filtergc("function", {
    Name = "FireWeapon",
    Constants = { "Ammo", "Reload" },
}, true)

return target ~= nil
```

Function filters support `Name`, `IgnoreExecutor`, `Hash`, `Constants`, and `Upvalues`. Table filters support `Keys`, `Values`, `KeyValuePairs`, and `Metatable`. Pass `true` as the third argument only when the first match is sufficient; otherwise handle the returned match array and return only a compact summary.

By default, function filtering ignores executor-created functions. Set `IgnoreExecutor = false` only when executor-created closures are intentionally in scope.

Fall back to `getgc` only when `filtergc` is unavailable in the active executor or the required predicate cannot be expressed by its filters. Keep the fallback type-gated, bounded where possible, and return only the matches needed for the task.

## Filter instances with `QueryDescendants`

Prefer the MCP `search-instances` tool because it already runs `QueryDescendants` against a chosen root and limits the response. Use selectors to push filtering into the query:

```text
Part.Tagged[Anchored = false]
Model > Humanoid
#HumanoidRootPart
RemoteEvent, RemoteFunction
```

In custom Luau, keep the root as narrow as possible:

```luau
local enemies = workspace:QueryDescendants("Model.Enemy:has(Humanoid)")
local paths = {}

for index, enemy in enemies do
    if index > 20 then
        break
    end
    paths[index] = enemy:GetFullName()
end

return paths
```

Selectors can express class, tag, name, property, and attribute criteria; chained criteria; `>`, `>>`, and comma combinators; and `:not()` or `:has()`.

Use direct indexing or `FindFirstChild` for one already-known path. Use a manual `GetDescendants()` pass only when the predicate depends on logic that selectors cannot express. Even then, first narrow the root or candidate set with `QueryDescendants`.
